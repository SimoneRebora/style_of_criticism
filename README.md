The <b>"Extend_lexicons.py"</b> file contains a script for expanding the lexicons in the "lexicons" folder through the fastText Italian Pre-trained word vector: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md<br/>
The <b>Style_of_criticism_step1.R</b> file contains a script for the analysis of the texts in the "corpus" folder (NOTE: in this repository they are just empty files), through stylomety and word classification. It also generates files to be analyzed with the LIWC software: https://liwc.wpengine.com/<br/>
The <b>Style_of_criticism_step2.R</b> file contains an SVM classifier, that works on the results of the previous analysis and evaluate the quality of the classification.
